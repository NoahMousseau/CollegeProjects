//Stacks
//Stacks are last in first out types of containers
//Only the top element is accessible at any given time, you cannot traverse stacks
//A stack can be inplmented as a linked list, with a restriction that insertions and deletions can only be performed on one end of the list
//Stacks only have 3 operations:
//  push: adds an element to the top of a stack
//  pop: removes an element from the top of a stack
//  top: obtains the element that is currently on top of a stack
//A stack can be implemented with a linked list or a vector
//  a vector stack may be preferable when the max number of elements is known beforehand

//For a linked list stack:
//  push: inserts at the back/front of the list
//  pop: deletes the element at the front of the list
//  top: examines the element at the front of the list

//For a vector stack:
//  push: call push_back in Vector
//  pop: call pop_back in Vector
//  top: call back in Vector
